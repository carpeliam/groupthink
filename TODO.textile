h1. -crappy-+good+ interface.

Well doesn't this just need some TLC. It's running Sass with "Compass":http://github.com/chriseppstein/compass now, but half the CSS is reset without a suitable replacement. Color and layout are in flux.

h1. tagging

Documents and artifacts will support tagging, so you'll be able to see them together. Hierarchical tagging would be great, we'll see what's easy.

h1. watchable groups

There's some really basic watch support, but it's *really* basic. at first, group members will just get emails every time a document/artifact is created/updated. But eventually, you'll be able to set watches on other groups, and set watches up based on tags.

h1. ...and more.

RSS feeds, OpenID, JSON support and REST API, _authorization_ (so you don't go deleting other groups' documents- be nice 'til then!), different visibility scopes, moving documents from one group to another... who even knows.
